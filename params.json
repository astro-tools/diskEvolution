{"name":"diskEvolution","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is a project to port a protoplanetary disk evolution simulation to Java.\r\n\r\nA team of undergraduate researchers at Arizona State University\r\nis working with Prof. Shumway in Physics and\r\nProf. Desch in Astrophysics to implement this simulation tool in Java.\r\nThe work is based on algorithms and Fortran codes used by Prof. Desch\r\nand graduate students Mike Lesniak (Ph. D. 2012) and Nikhil Monga.\r\n\r\n# Building and running the application\r\n\r\nTo build and run the project:\r\n\r\n1. Download the source using git or from a zip file.\r\n\r\n2. Add the required external jar files to the lib directory as described in \r\n   [lib/README.md](https://github.com/shumway/diskEvolution/blob/master/lib/README).\r\n\r\n3. Run ant from the source directory.\r\n\r\n        ant jar\r\n\r\n4. Run with “ant run” or the run script.\r\n\r\n        bash runApp.sh\r\n","tagline":"Java code to model a protoplanetary disk in astrophysics.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
